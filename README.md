# Matrix multiplication algorithms

This project consists of different matrix multiplication algorithms and tools for testing their correctness and execution speed. The project is the result of work in which we wanted to compare different simple algorithms for matrix multiplication. Here you can find the code which we used to obtain the results presented in the article.
